This folder contains some scripts I used to get an incredibly cheap (16â‚¬) bluetooth gps module to work. I think I was able to read the NMEA data directly with cat from the virtual serial device. I had to manually tell gpsd not to change the baud rate of the serial device since a change caused any communication with the module to fail, it would simply not react on anything until it ran out of battery and thus "rebooted".
